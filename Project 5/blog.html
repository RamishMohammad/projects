        <p style="font-size:28px"> <em> The biggest chalenge I faced with this Assignment was trying to use Git and getting used to its commmands. 
            Other than that the actual coding part of this assignemnt was the easiest bit as I coded along with the Professor in the class so I had 
            all the code needed for the tasks already. Other than that I think the uploading part of the assignment on to the aerver is also going to 
            be a challenge but looking forward to it.</em></p>

        <p style="font-size:28px"> <em> The biggest challenge that I faced with this assignment was the side bar for the flow char as 
            I could not get the spacing right for it in the beginning and after a lotof trial and error I got it to work. This assignemnt really did feel like an assignment as I really 
            did design something from the start and I really enjoyed it. I still have a lot of questions about it and 
            I am looking forward to learning more.</em></p>

        <p style="font-size:28px"> <em> This Assignment defiinitely was way harder than the prevous ones just accessign values inseted by the user and using them to build a 
            sorting function and adding new posts was more challenging than anyone would guess. It is starting to get real and hard and i can guess what the future holds for 
            this class. I definitel now want to get started on the final projet and get a head start</em></p>

            the data structures assignment but I saw that this was due before that so I was like what? 
            but I am glad I checked and found out it was due earlier. the Assignemnt overall 
            was much simpler and easy to do than the other 2 assignment we recently got but it has a 
            neccesity and its an important task</em></p>

        <p style="font-size:28px"> <em> This Assignment was one of the hardest ones so far eventhough by the end when we actually 
            understood how it works it got failry easy. The intial part of this assignment was the hardest as undertsanding how all
            the different files interact with one another and actually at the end collaborate together to output to the page. It was 
            a really fun assignemnt as I personally learned a lot but I believe their should be more explanation for the server side as
            I was going through the lecture and it kinda just went over that part and I didnt entireley know what was doing what in the server file.
